Completed:

1.) Enemy Health Bar
3.) Knockback (although it isn't very smooth)

Attempted:

2.) Heartbeat -- Can't get it to loop continuously through low health. Can only get it to sound when having low health and while getting damaged.
                 It would go silent every time I would put the function call in update by itself + only worked if put inside exiting if statement
                 or TakeDamage
